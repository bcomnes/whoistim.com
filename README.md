Tim Erickson, 26, is a digital product designer, photographer, videographer and occassional music producer. Tim was born at a very young age in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. His early interests in model rocketry, computer building, video game design, and short film direction would serve as inspiration for a career in digital creative production across a multi-sensory canvas. 

Taking an interest in internet forums would lead him to pick write his first lines of front-end code at 14, and later lead him to help start and operate a few successful online communities. At 16 he founded a small digital creative agency, neutyp, with a few online friends from these communities. neutyp professionally served clients seeking website design and development services, and served as a home to his first entrepreneurial expirements, theurld, readotw, and catalog, among others.

At 19 he dropped out of the [College of Visual Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Visual_Arts) to co-found Spice Apps with high-school friend Craig Condon. [Spice Apps](https://www.minnpost.com/minnov8/2009/11/spice-apps-knows-how-spice-social-media-tools-likes-clove) initially built several web server multimedia tools, Ginger and Basil, to play video and audio files, and later focused on building services around a social content curation tool called [Clove](http://www.twincities.com/2009/10/23/clove-looks-to-spice-up-the-web/). Piloting the technology in early 2011 to a number of household brands headquartered in Minnesota, Spice Apps built internet communities around niche interests and brand sponsored content. This content curation and collection behaviour was later perfected for consumers by Pinterest. 

Spice Apps would then go on to explore the problems of enterprise knowledge sharing with email newsletter creation tool Team Digest, and efficient cross-browser testing with [BrowserTap](http://browsertap.com/). BrowserTap found initial success following [it's debut](http://tech.mn/news/2012/11/08/techdotmn-swtc4-browser-tap/) at a weekend hackathon in Minnesota. Spice Apps ran from 2009 to 2012. 

Before briefly considering [Portland](http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2011/08/portland_incubator_experiment_attracts_290_applica.html), Tim and Craig both moved to San Francisco in 2013 to join young startup ClassDojo. From 2013 to 2014 Tim helped ClassDojo grow to be used by 2 in 3 schools in the US, and allow teachers to capture one billion moments of student behaviour.  Tim joined BrightBytes, another education-tech startup, later in 2014 to help service school districts directly with data visualization tools to track school performance, budget, and digital safety. One such tool could predict, as early as first grade, with 90% accuracy, a student dropping out. 

Joining Inkling from 2015 to 2017, Tim led product design for Inkling's consumer-facing learning application, Axis. Inkling, originally built around e-book authoring, today uses it's content authoring platform to deliver training and reference materials to large distributed deskless workforces. 

Since picking up his first SLR camera at 14, Tim has captured the world through his eye and his camera, occassionally [showing those images](https://www.instagram.com/timerickson/) back to the world.
