Tim Erickson, 26, is a digital product designer, photographer, videographer and occassional music producer. Tim was born at a very young age in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. His early interests in model rocketry, computer building, video game design, and short film direction would serve as inspiration for a career in digital creative production across a multi-sensory canvas. 

Taking an interest in internet forums would lead him to write his first lines of front-end code at 14, and later lead him to help start and operate a few successful online communities. At 16 he founded a small digital creative agency, neutyp, with a few online friends from these communities. neutyp professionally served clients seeking website design and development services, and served as a home to his first entrepreneurial expirements, theurld, readotw, and catalog, among others.

At 19 he dropped out of the [College of Visual Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Visual_Arts) to co-found Spice Apps with high-school friend Craig Condon. [Spice Apps](https://www.minnpost.com/minnov8/2009/11/spice-apps-knows-how-spice-social-media-tools-likes-clove) initially built several web server multimedia tools, Ginger and Basil, to play video and audio files, and later focused on building services around a social content curation tool called [Clove](http://www.twincities.com/2009/10/23/clove-looks-to-spice-up-the-web/). Piloting the technology in early 2011 to a number of household brands headquartered in Minnesota, Spice Apps built internet communities around niche interests and brand sponsored content. This content curation and collection behaviour was later perfected for consumers by Pinterest. 

Spice Apps would later explore the problems of enterprise knowledge sharing with email newsletter creation tool Team Digest, and efficient cross-browser testing with [BrowserTap](http://browsertap.com/). BrowserTap found initial success following [it's debut](http://tech.mn/news/2012/11/08/techdotmn-swtc4-browser-tap/) at a weekend hackathon in Minnesota. Spice Apps ran from 2009 to 2012. 

Before briefly considering [Portland](http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2011/08/portland_incubator_experiment_attracts_290_applica.html), Tim and Craig would both move to San Francisco in 2013 to join young startup ClassDojo.
